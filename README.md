# Github coding challenge

## Installation
run 'npm install' to install all dependencies
run 'npm start' to start the server and open http://localhost:1234 in your browser

## Wireframe
See wireframe.png it's a simple wireframe that shows the app in the searched state for mobile and desktop to plan responsiveness
A description of what the page is for could be useful at the top of the page.

## TODO - If I had more time
- Handle errors better in what I display to the user, especially 404s
- Configure react-query better, some defaults are not ideal
- Display the user's avatar (not in scope of the challenge)
- Add better tests, the tests also do not use best practice wherby they should be testing how the user interacts with the app. Not finding by name etc
- Fix type definitions for react-query errors
- Add more information to the repo cards, again not in scope, but I added the description and language anyway to add more interest
