# Github coding challenge

## Installation
run 'npm install' to install all dependencies
run 'npm start' to start the server and open http://localhost:1234 in your browser

## Wireframe
See wireframe.png it's a simple wireframe that shows the app in the searched state for mobile and desktop to plan responsiveness
A description of what the page is for could be useful at the top of the page.

## TODO - If I had more time
- Handle errors better in what I display to the user, especially 404s
- Configure react-query better, some defaults are not ideal
- Add better tests, the tests also do not use best practice whereby they should be testing how the user interacts with the app. Not finding by name etc
- Fix type definitions for react-query errors and error display in general
- Add more information to the repo cards, it's not in scope, but I added the description and language anyway to add more interest
- Animate a loading spinner when the user searches
- Animate the repo cards when they are added to the page
- Fix the height of the search button to match the input
- Create a quick favicon and site icon

## Possible enhancements
- Add a filter to the search results to filter by language, title, description etc
- Add a sort to the search results
- Add a pagination to the search results
- Display the user's avatar/profile above search results
- Append the search term to the url so that the user can share the search results and go back to them
- Create a light and dark theme, either allow the user to switch or use the system preference
